				"actions like the SumThreshold method work only on single values, not on complex "

				"has currently no parameters.";
		case ChangeResolutionActionType:
			return

				"part of the algorithm and should normally not be changed. Currently changes only "

				"baselines to iterate over (0. All, 1. CrossCorrelations, 2. AutoCorrelations, "
				"3. Baselines that are redundant to current selected, 4. Auto correlations of "
				"the current antenna, 5. don't iterate, only process current), thread-count : "
				"number of threads to spawn simultaneously.";
		case ForEachPolarisationBlockType:
			return
				"Iterate over the polarisations that are already in memory. Note that the "
				"LoadImageAction actually defines which polarisations are read in memory in "
				"the first place. This action has no parameters.";

		case SetFlaggingActionType:
			return
				"This is an action that is part of the algorithm and should normally not be "
				"changed. "
				"It initializes or changes the flags in memory. Its single parameter new-flagging "
				"defines how to initialize or set the flags (0. None, 1. Everything, 2. FromOriginal, "
				"3. Invert, 4. PolarisationsEqual, 5. FlagZeros).";
		case SetImageActionType:
			return
				"(Re-)initialize the time frequency data in memory. Parameter 'new-image' defines "
				"how to initialize (0 means set the entire image to zero, 1 means that, if the "
				"image has been changed by e.g. a surface fit, restore the image (a copy "
				"of the original data is left in memory, so this does not perform IO). This is "
				"part of the algorithm and should normally not be changed.";
		case SlidingWindowFitActionType:

				"settings work well for other configurations as well (and surface fitting is not "
				"the most crucial part of the flagger - because of the SumThreshold method, even "
				"bad fits produce reasonable results). Note that the ChangeResolutionAction"
				"changes the meaning of these absolute values as well.";

				"to set whether the method is allowed to look to combinations of time and frequency directions. "
				"If you expect strong transient effects that you do not want to flag, set frequency-direction-flagging "
				"to 0 to make sure that frequencies are not combined. Not that the algorithm normally iterates "
				"and executes the SumThreshold method several times with different sensitivities. Therefore, if you "
				"like to change the sensitivity "
				"of the algorithm in order to flag less or more samples, you have to change the sensitivity of all "
				"Threshold actions by the same factor. A higher sensitivity-value means that less values are flagged.";

				"of the algorithm.";
